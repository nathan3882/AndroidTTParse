# Android Timetable Train Parse
Android Timetable Train Parse works in partnership with my thick desktop client named TTrainParse where majority of computation occurs.<br><br>
Android TTrainParse offers a more convenient illustration for a student that has previously registered with my TTrainParse service to allow them to view,
without hopping between considerable amounts of internet reliant applications, their lessons + those lessons' associated trains <br><br>
